# Description
This Java-based application is designed to detect and extract text and numbers from images. It employs image preprocessing techniques, optical character recognition (OCR), and data extraction methods to achieve this task efficiently. The goal is to provide a robust and accurate solution for extracting textual and numerical information from images.

# Requirements:- 
  Image Preprocessing:
        The application includes image preprocessing techniques to enhance the quality of input images. These techniques may involve:
  Resizing: 
    Images can be resized to a standard dimension to improve processing efficiency.
  Noise Reduction: 
    Apply noise reduction algorithms to clean up the image and improve OCR accuracy.
  Contrast Adjustment: 
    Adjust image contrast to enhance text and number visibility.
  Grayscale Conversion: 
    Convert images to grayscale to simplify OCR processing.

  Text and Number Detection:- 
    To detect and recognize text and numbers within the images, the application utilizes an OCR module. You can choose to        implement this module using existing OCR libraries such as Tesseract or create a custom OCR algorithm tailored to your       specific needs. The OCR module should Accurately identify text and numbers in images.

  Data Extraction:-
    The application extracts the detected text and numbers in plain text from the images and presents them in a structured       format.

  Performance Optimization:-
    To optimize performance, especially when dealing with large images, used java multithreading concept.

# Getting Started
  To get started with the Text/Number Detection in Images application, follow these steps:

    1. Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
          https://github.com/akhilesh-anthwal-vs/Text_Detection_Application.git
    
    2. Install Dependencies: Install any required dependencies or libraries, such as Tesseract, OpenCV.

    3. Build the Application: Build the Java application using a Java IDE.

    4. Configure OCR: Configure OCR library like Tesseract, ensure it's correctly configured with any language                       models or settings required for your specific use case.

# Usage

Once the application is built and configured, you can use it to detect and extract text and numbers from images. Here are the general steps for using the application:

Hit the POST  url (http://localhost:8085/textdetection?textLanguage=eng) from the postman or any other tool.
Provide Files in the body->form-data.  Kay is "file" and value is selected image
add Param key as textLanguage and value as eng/hin (textLanguage is a language that is present in the image and you want that text )

Extracted text and numbers will be presented in a structured format, which can be saved to a file or further processed as needed.

# Performance Considerations 
  Efficient performance is crucial when dealing with image processing and OCR. To optimize performance:
  
  Consider utilizing multi-threading to speed up the detection and extraction process.
  Monitor resource utilization to ensure the application runs smoothly, especially when processing large volumes of images.
